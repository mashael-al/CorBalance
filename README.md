About This Project

This CorBalance project represents the successful conclusion of an intensive web development course focused on mastering ASP.NET Core.

During the bootcamp, I developed a comprehensive fitness and wellness web application that integrates various key features, such as user profiles, fitness plans, nutrition guides, wellness tips, community engagement, and more—all designed with a smooth and responsive Arabic interface.

This project showcases my skills in:

- Building scalable web applications using ASP.NET Core
- Designing a user-friendly and accessible UI using Bootstrap and custom CSS
- Implementing routing, controllers, and views in an MVC architecture
- Managing source control and versioning via Git and GitHub

This experience not only honed my technical expertise but also enhanced my project management, problem-solving, and collaboration skills—essential skills for any professional developer. CorBalance is a reflection of my dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions that positively impact users' health and lifestyle.

I am excited to continue building on these foundations and contribute to more challenging and impactful projects in the future.
