CorBalance 

Final Project at Tuwaiq Academy Web Bootcamp

This project was developed as the culmination of a month-long ASP.NET Core web development bootcamp at Tuwaiq Academy.

During the bootcamp, I learned how to build modern, scalable web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, connect to databases via Entity Framework Core, and design interactive interfaces using Bootstrap.
